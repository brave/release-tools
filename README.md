Scripts and tools used for releasing browser-laptop and extensions

Some of our tools include..
- [Update extensions](https://github.com/brave/release-tools/blob/master/bin/updateExtensions.js#L7). Is used with https://github.com/brave/vault-updater to generate local brave extensions and manifests. Update extensions can also upload crx (zip) archives to s3 and thus to the brave extensions server.
